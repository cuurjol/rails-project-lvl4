        main_title: Github repositories quality analyzer (RQA)
        description_1: >-
          A service where Github users can check the quality of the code in their public repositories. You will be
          able to add your repositories from your Github account after authenticating through Github on our service.
        description_2: >-
          Code quality checks for registered repositories are run manually, where the latest commit is taken from all
          existing commits, or automatically, when you create a new commit. If the checks fail or find stylistic errors
          (or suspicious constructs), then our service sends a final result report to your email which linked to your
          Github account.
        description_3: >-
          All completed checks will be available on your registered repository page of our service.
